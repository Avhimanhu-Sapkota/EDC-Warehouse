(1, 'A Deeper Look into Every-Day Carry', '<p>When I look across the Internet, I find that many groups use this term. Knives, Flashlights, Cameras, Pens, Handguns, and a great many other things often have the label of EDC attached to them. Many interest groups claim that it originated with them. I have no idea when this term came into being or where it came from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEveryday carry seem obvious enough but when you look closer you will see that the definition can be quite loose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf we carry a certain Item 5 days out of the week, is it EDC? I think it still is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat if we carry an item all of the time except under special conditions when we substitute it with a more specialized tool or larger tool? I still think it is EDC but this is open to debate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI generally think of an EDC item as a smaller than normal item that is carried with an individual most of the time but I can see how that does not always hold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEDC I think is different things to different people in one way or another. I have seen people debate about this subject but sometimes they only see if from their point of view. A person in a rural area might have different needs than a person from a city. One person&rsquo;s life might depend on his EDC one day while another person just likes to have the item. EDC might be different for people depending on their occupation or hobbies. One person may EDC a full sized item where other carries a small item. I am not sure how tight or how loose the boundaries of EDC should be. Perhaps we can figure this out or maybe there is no perfect answer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy would a person EDC? My thoughts are that there are many reasons that people would do so. It could be that it is really useful and practical to EDC many items for daily use. Some items may be carried a lot but used little awaiting some need that might occur. Several EDC items are functional or non-functional luxury items or status symbols. An EDC item can be a comfort item or just fun to have and play with. I am sure there are many other reasons besides these.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf it is in your car everyday, is that another level of EDC? I don&#39;t know what I think on this but have had the thought many times. Maybe there are levels of EDC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is my hope that we will have people from all walks of life from diverse groups by occupation, hobby, region, lifestyle, and any other thing that might make our look at EDC more well rounded. If I get the kind of group I would like to see, I think we run the risk of many disagreements on things but also the opportunity to learn from each other as well.</p>\r\n', 'JonSidney', '2019-11-01', 'EDC', 'journal1.jpg'),

Whatever they happen to need that day or items that serve them well in their job or their lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some men might opt to carry a little and others a lot. So where do they store them? We know that filling out suit pockets with heavy items can harm the suit and stretch the fabric. So here are a few bags that you might find can help keep all of your EDC gear in an organized fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wallet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/mens-wallet-billfold-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">wallet</a>&nbsp;has long been used as a method of carrying cheques, bills, coins and credit cards. Today, men are using their wallets as fashionable accessories. Whether you prefer a classic billfold, a slim sleeve or a coat wallet that slides neatly into your breast pocket, there is an extensive range of wallets available for the discerning gentleman, however most use cheap leather that ages poorly. Also, the colors available are usually limited to brown and black and the nylon and plastic liners just don&rsquo;t do a custom suit justice. &nbsp;Therefore we recommend wallets made of all aniline dyed leather because they will age well, develop a patina and bring your pleasure for years to come. Take a look at out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/leather-goods/leather-wallets\" target=\"_blank\">favorite wallets</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cell-phone-etiquette/\">cell phone</a>&nbsp;has become a staple of everyday life. The most used item in EDC, the smartphone is a lifeline for emergencies, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/leica-100-years-photography/\">camera</a>&nbsp;for memories and a database of information. We can check email, send instant messages and even do our banking with it. With millions of apps, there is no limit to what can be achieved via cell phone. Of course, the only limit is what we place upon ourselves. For that, take a look at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cell-phone-etiquette/\">cell phone etiquette guide</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keys</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keys are a necessity. We use them to drive our cars, enter and lock our homes and gain access to a variety of other things like offices, boats, cabins, even bicycles. What a gentleman hangs his keys on is often a direct reflection of who he is. Is the keychain a plastic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/beer-guide/\">beer</a>&nbsp;can? Perhaps a rubber Homer Simpson? Maybe it&rsquo;s a simple rhodium key ring. A lot can be told by the accessories a man chooses.

And you may honestly&nbsp;be&nbsp;wondering, what in the world does &quot;EDC&quot; stand for? It stands for&nbsp;&quot;Every Day Carry&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A person&#39;s EDC Gear is exactly what it sounds like...It&#39;s the stuff they&nbsp;carry every day. Often times it&#39;s in&nbsp;their&nbsp;pockets or on their&nbsp;belts. But this gear can sometimes&nbsp;spill over into backpacks,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/edc-gear-storage-ideas-2016\" target=\"_blank\">organizers</a>&nbsp;and more (especially if you&#39;re like us!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>WHY WOULD I NEED TO &quot;EVERYDAY CARRY&quot; A BUNCH OF STUFF?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Good question! The short answer is, the items in this list are going to make your life a lot easier, allow you to deal with emergencies and to complete everyday tasks more efficiently.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;let&#39;s go ahead and get started on our top 10 list of everyday carry items...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. A good, sharp knife:<br />\r\nIf you&nbsp;are new to knives we recommend starting with a small knife like the<a href=\"http://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/top-edc-folding-knives-under-100\" target=\"_blank\">Victorinox Cadet</a>. This little knife has a great blade on it, but also has some other great tools on board that can come in handy for everyday purposes (nail file, bottle opener, screwdriverand more).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A knife is the most important part of anyone&#39;s everyday carry, because of all the versatility it adds to your life.&nbsp;Which is why we&#39;ve included it at #1 on our list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common EDC Tasks for a Knife:&nbsp;Opening Packages | Cutting Threads or Rope | Maintenance of tools or other every day items | Food Prep | Emergency Tool |&nbsp;First Aid | Self Defense</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Looking for some other great&nbsp;knives suited for EDC?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/top-edc-folding-knives-under-100\" target=\"_blank\">View our top 7 EDC Knives under $100 here</a>.</em><br />\r\n2. A slimmed down wallet:<br />\r\nWe&#39;re obviously very passionate about this one...And it&#39;s not because we sell slim wallets. It&#39;s&nbsp;because we believe a slim wallet is the only wallet worth carrying.&nbsp;And you can read why we believe a slimmed down wallet is so important&nbsp;<a href=\"http://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/slim-down-your-wallet-more-carry-options-less-back-pain\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. No one needs to be carrying around a big &#39;ole trifold that is 4 inches thick. Ditch the junk, carry only the essentials and get into a<a href=\"http://recycledfirefighter.com/collections/wallets\" target=\"_blank\">nice slim wallet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common EDC Tasks for a Wallet:&nbsp;Carrying your identification | Carrying your means to pay for Goods &amp; Services | And looking like a total boss if said wallet is from&nbsp;Recycled Firefighter<br />\r\n3. Cash:<br />\r\nNow that you&#39;ve got yourself a killer slimmed down wallet, fill that bad boy up<em>with only the essentials</em>&nbsp;and somecash. Yes, cash.&nbsp;It&#39;s alarming how few people carry cash on them these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few reasons why you should &quot;every day carry&quot; cash:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cards aren&#39;t accepted everywhere.</li>\r\n	<li>Leaving tips for servers or someone who has done a particular service for you (hair cuts, valet, etc).</li>\r\n	<li>Cash has more bargaining power in some cases (resulting in you getting a better deal).</li>\r\n	<li>Your bank could put a hold on your account for some reason.</li>\r\n	<li>Power or card readers could fail, leaving you with no way to pay. For that matter, your actual card could fail as well.</li>\r\n	<li>A disaster could occur leaving&nbsp;cash as&nbsp;the only way of paying for items.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Carry&nbsp;along a decent amount of cash so you&#39;re ready if you can&#39;t use your card, or if the situation is better suited for cash.<br />\r\n4. Flashlight:<br />\r\nBeing able to illuminate a dark situation is crucial. Let&#39;s say you get a flat tire and you&#39;re stuck on the side of a dark road&nbsp;at 2am - Do you want to attempt to change that tire in the dark? Or let&#39;s say you went out for a hike with only what was on you&nbsp;(which we don&#39;t advise) and it got dark before you&nbsp;were finished...Do you want to hike out in the pitch black?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A flashlight can come in handy for a variety&nbsp;of emergency reasons. But I find myself using my flashlight in my everyday life as well. Find something reliable and compact that uses common batteries and clip it to your pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common EDC Tasks for a Flashlight:&nbsp;Lighting up dark rooms or the outdoors | Spotlighting something to show someone what you&#39;re talking about (if you&#39;re too lazy to get up) | Gently illuminating a dark room when others are asleep (instead of turning the light on) | Emergency Lighting | Self Defense Tool (threat identification) | Signaling<br />\r\n5. Your cell phone:<br />\r\nThis is something 99.9% of us already EDC, but it&#39;s worth mentioning. If you feel like you&#39;re not suited for carrying gear everyday, take a pause here. You&#39;re already carrying your phone everyday. Just imagine how much of your life you&#39;ve based around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now with that same logic, apply it&nbsp;to the other items in this article. Before too long you&#39;ll push your phone down the list of priorities and your other items will be more important&nbsp;to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Jacob Starr', '2019-12-10', 'Beginners guide', 'journal3.jpg');
